**Fix for Wildman event for custom races**
Whenever a wildman event occurs, Rimworld ignores the custom race's backstories and randomly assigns a backstory from the entire pool of backstories. This is fixed by calling two seperate events. The first is the Wanderer join event, this is an event which respects a custom race's backstory. However, the wanderer will immediately join the player's faction and not act like a wildman. This is fixed by combining it with the Running Wild event which will cause a player's character to immediately revert to a wildman.

**Cloth Colours**

**Spacer Armour**
If the mod "Save Our Spaceship 2" is loaded. The file automatically patches the spacer suit to become an EVA suit to allow for space exploration.
